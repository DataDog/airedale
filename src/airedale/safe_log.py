"""Describe an exception for a log line without its message or its traceback values.

The message of an exception can hold data that came from an MCP server or from pi: the validation error of the MCP
SDK for a ``tools/list`` result holds the whole tool object, and a ``ValueError`` from ``int()`` holds the value. Logs
go to terminals and CI systems, so a log line about such an exception gets only the type names and the place in the
code, never ``exc_info`` and never ``str(exception)``.
